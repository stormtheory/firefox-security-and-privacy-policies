# firefox-security-and-privacy-policies
The purpose is to create a template for everyday browsing and security combining usable DISA STIGs with Common-sense privacy and security practices. Think LibreWolf but without another group in the middle.

Q: Why a policy and a config file? 
A: I have found that a policy file can do stuff a config file can not do 
  and stuff a config file can do but a policy file can not. I wish it was as simple as one or the other.
Q: I made changes to the policy file but I do not see changes being made.
A: Make sure the policy file is named, permissioned, and placed in the right place on your system. 
   Use the URL of about:support to get to the support window and see if there is a policy error 
   meaning most likely a json format error.

Run the configure-firefox.sh script to install the new policies and config file.
